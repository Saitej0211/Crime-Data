# Crime Forecasting Analysis

## Overview

The Crime Forecasting Analysis project explores cutting-edge techniques in crime prediction using machine learning and deep learning. By analyzing historical crime data and external factors, this project aims to improve our understanding of crime trends and enhance crime prevention strategies.

## Introduction

With advancements in technology and data availability, crime prediction is undergoing significant transformation. This project leverages machine learning and deep learning to detect and predict crime patterns, offering a proactive approach to public safety. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating external factors like social events, weather, and economic indicators into prediction models to enhance accuracy and effectiveness.

## Summary of Results

Key findings from the analysis include:
- **Crime Trends:** A general rise in crime rates from 2020 to 2022, followed by a decline in 2023, with anomalies in early 2023 potentially due to policy changes.
- **Seasonal Patterns:** Increased crime rates in the middle of the year, with significant spikes during specific times, such as during the COVID-19 shutdown.
- **Demographics and Location:** Higher crime rates among individuals aged 0-20, and varying crime rates across different neighborhoods and genders.
- **Time Patterns:** Crime rates peak in the afternoon and decline towards midnight.

## Data Sources

Data was sourced from a government website providing crime incident reports for Los Angeles from 2020. The dataset includes manually transcribed records, with some potential inaccuracies due to the transcription process. Missing values and redundant information were addressed during data cleaning.

## Methods

- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and imputed missing demographic data.
- **Analysis:** Utilized pandas and numpy for statistical analysis and visualization of crime trends across various parameters, including gender, age, and time of day.

## Limitations

- **Geographic Scope:** Findings are based solely on Los Angeles data, which may not fully represent other cities.
- **Data Quality:** Potential biases and inaccuracies in the dataset could impact results.

## Future Work

- **Data Expansion:** Collect and analyze data from additional major cities to provide a more comprehensive view of crime patterns.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Examine crime trends across different cities to understand variations in crime dynamics and law enforcement strategies.
